# JavaScript Function Bug: Handling Null and Falsy Values

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in a JavaScript function that handles null values and illustrates how to improve its robustness. The function `foo` adds two numbers; however, it does not correctly handle cases where it may receive falsy values (other than null) as inputs. 

## Bug Description

The `foo` function uses strict equality (`===`) to check for null values. While this works for strictly null inputs, it fails to account for other falsy values that might be passed as arguments, leading to unexpected results. For instance, if an argument is 0, an empty string, or `undefined`, it's considered falsy, but the function may not provide the intended behavior. 

## Solution

The improved function (`bugSolution.js`) uses loose equality (`==`) or explicit checks for each falsy value to handle a wider range of potential inputs.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `bug.js` file.
3. Run the file in a JavaScript environment (e.g., Node.js, browser's console).
4. Observe the output for different input combinations, including null, 0, "", and undefined.
